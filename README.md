# Docu.Me - Documentation Portal Generator

Docu.Me generates clear,  searchable, easy-to-customize documentation portal for APIs from your Swagger specifications.
Built with Java and designed with Bootstrap and Jquery, it is based on the current version of the [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) formerly known as Swagger.

This documentation generator tool will:

 - create a dedicated API documentation page for each and every single one of API services defined in a swagger file
 - will allow execution of an API service from its own API documentation page, and display its results on the same page
 - pre-populate the API documentation pages with a predefined API environment variable if it is required to call the API services.(See the set API key installation section)
 - generate an example section during the API documentation creation by executing API call requests based on the most recent implementation. Thus, all response examples are always up to date (See How to Run section) 
	  
You can create your own swagger.yaml file with [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/).

This repo contains the content and specifications for the [Amadeus Travel Innovation Sandbox](https://sandbox.amadeus.com).  

This is a Spring boot project built with [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) (STS).
You can download/clone the repo and import it as an existing project into workspace in STS.
It is a Maven project so it has all required dependencies in the pom.xml.

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/install.html)

This is a simple [tutorial](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/) I followed to install them.


## How to run 
### APIKEY environment variable
If the API services defined in the swagger file require an APIKEY variable to run, you need to specify its value in your environment.
You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).
Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.

### Input parameters
There are two required arguments


- *swagger file path*:  The full swagger yaml file path location from which the API documentation should be created for

- *live example flag*: if true, an example section will be generated on the fly by calling the API service with default values, if false, no example section will be present at the end of the generation, but each API documentation page can still be manually edited to add one later. 

## Installation
Clone the project into your local. You can follow one of the ways to generate documentation.

### From terminal

Go into the docuDemo folder :

	$ cd docu.me/docuDemo/
	$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="swagger file path,live example flag"	


### From Spring Tool Suite

* Import _docuDemo_ folder as *Existing Maven Project*. Go to the DocuDemoApplication class and click Run configurations.
* Go to Arguments tab and set the "*swagger file path*,*live example flag*" as explained above.
* Go to Environment > New . Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.
* Click Apply > Run.

### From Eclipse

* Select the _docuDemo_ folder and import it as *Existing Maven Project*.
* Once the project is imported. Select Run > Run Configurations. Create a new Java Application.
* Set the Main class. Click on the Search button and select "DocuDemoApplication" from com.docume.main package.
* Go to Arguments tab and enter the following two arguments:
  - the full path file location of your swagger yaml file of your API (*swagger file path*). (ex C:/myproject/documentation/myswagger.yml)
  - a boolean value (*live example flag*): true indicating that you want to generate examples on the fly by calling your API, false otherwise.
* Go to Environment > New . Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.
* Click Apply > Run.

## Output

* Your API documentation will be generated under a new folder named _Portal_ located at the root level. You may need to refresh your project in order to see the changes.
* An index.html is your starting point to access your  different APIs and response models of the API documentation generated by Docu.Me.

### Customize it your way!

There are 3 pages to focus on:

### Index Page

Here we have list of APIs and list of response models in our APIs.

* The list of APIs come from the operationID present in the swagger.yml file.
* The list of models come from swagger.getDefinitions() which gives a Map.

### API documentation page

We can see 10 sections on this page.

* Title : Title comes from the [info object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#info-object) mentioned in the swagger file.
* Summary : Summary tag from yaml file, [Operation object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject).
* Description : Description tag from the yaml file, [Operation object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject).
* HttpMethod : We get HttpMethod from path.getOperationMap(), [path](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#paths-object) which gives us Map of HttpMethod, Operation.
* Resource URL : This is build using  schemes/host/basePath/paths from the [swagger yaml file](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#swagger-object).
* Query Parameters : Paramters object from the Operations contains [parameters](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject).
* Tags : Tags provided in the yaml file. This can be used for categorizing bunch of APIs together.
* Responses : Responses are provided by [Response](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#responsesObject) object.
* Example : Example section is displayed if you pass true for generating example data by calling the actual API, this is explained above while passing arguments to the application.
* Result : The response generated by 'Send request' is displayed here.
* Response Schema : This is created from the Model's definition provided by [Definition](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#definitionsObject) in the swagger yaml.

### Response model documentation page

All the response models are listed here with all of their elements.This information comes from [schemaObject](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) mentioned in definitions object. Elements can be of type Array, String or Reference to another model.

## Mustache templates

When you want to make changes to the look and feel of the documentation portal mustache templates can be customized.
* You can follow [Mustache.js](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) guide for tweaking the mustache files.
* A list of mustache variables are present in Documentation.java class.
* Here, index.mustache creates index.html, model.mustache creates model.html and api.mustache creates {{api}}.html.
* In addition to changing the mustache files, one can customize the html files, just in case you want to add some static content that your swagger file could not accommodate!

### Limitations for generating examples

* Supports only API key authorization, can be worked on for OAuth authorization mechanism using swagger security tools.
* In this case your documentation portal will be generated as expected but you cannot 'Get a live response' which needs to call your API.
