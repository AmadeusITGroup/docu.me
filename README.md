Docu.Me - Documentation Portal Generator
=================================
Docu.Me is a static site generator for API documentation built with Java and UX is designed with Bootstrap and Jquery.
It is based on the current version of the [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) formerly known as Swagger.
You can create your own swagger.yaml file with [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)

This repo contains the content and specifications for the [Amadeus Travel Innovation Sandbox](https://sandbox.amadeus.com).  

This is a Spring boot project built with [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) (STS) .
You can download/clone the repo and import it as an existing project into workspace in STS.
It is a Maven project so has all required dependencies in the pom.xml.

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/install.html)

Simple [tutorial](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/) I followed, incase it helps !

## Set API key as environment variable.
You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).
Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.

### From terminal

Go on the project's root folder, then type:

	$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments = "args1,args2"
	args1 = Swagger yaml file location. For example "d:\\Userfiles\\nghate\\Desktop\\swg.yml"
	args2 = This parameter should be true if you want to generate examples on the fly by callling the API with default values or set to false.
	Your command will look like $ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments = "d:\\Userfiles\\nghate\\Desktop\\swg.yml, false"

### From Spring Tool Suite

* Import docuDemo folder as *Existing Maven Project*. Go to the DocuDemoApplication class and click Run configurations.
* Go to Arguments and pass  "args1,args2" as explained above.
* Go to Environment > New . Enter variable name as "APIKEY" and value with your apikey.
* Click Apply > Run.

## Output

* The output folder produced in your project folder contains index file with navigation to different APIs and response models of the API documentation.

### Customize it your way !

There are 3 pages to focus on:

1. Index Page

Here we have list of APIs and list of response models in our APIs.

* The list of APIs come from the operationID present in the swagger.yml file.
* The list of models come from swagger.getDefinitions() which gives Map<String, Model>.


2. API documentation page

We can see 10 sections on this page.

* Summary : Summary tag from yaml file,Operation object.
* Description : Description tag from the yaml file,Operation object.
* HttpMethod : We get HttpMethod from path.getOperationMap() which gives us Map<HttpMethod, Operation>.
* Resource URL : This is build using  schemes/host/basePath/paths from the swagger yaml file.
* Query Parameters : Paramters object from the Operations contains query parameters.
* Tags : Tags provided in the yaml file. This can be used for categorizing bunch of APIs together.
* Responses : Responses are provided by Operation object.
* Example : Example section is displayed if you pass true for generating example data by calling the actual API.
* Result : The response generated by 'Send request' is displayed here.
* Response Schema : This is created from the Model's definition provided in the swagger yaml.

3. Response model documentation page

All the response models are listed here with all of its elements. Elements can be of type Array, String or Reference to another model.
